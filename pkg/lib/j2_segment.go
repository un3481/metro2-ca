	// This special condition may be that a bankruptcy was filed, discharged, dismissed or withdrawn; a debt was reaffirmed; or the consumer cannot be located or is now located.
	// The indicator should be reported one time and will remain on file until another Consumer Information Indicator or a Removal value is reported.
	// As an option, the indicator may be reported each month as long as the condition applies.
